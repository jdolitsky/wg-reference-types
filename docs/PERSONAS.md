# Personas

In order to abstract away from specific use cases and
implementation details, we will use terms from the story
of *Glen and Larry’s Ice Cream Company*.

Each persona describes those involved in the
ice cream supply chain, and has a relevant parallel
relating to OCI and the surrounding software ecosystem.

In this document, we aim to characterize which persona(s)
this working group is designing around.

## Which persona are we designing around?

From the list of below, we are primarily designing to improve
the function of
**(3) The Refrigerated Truck Driver**.

This working group is equivalent to the strategy
team within the logitisics arm of *Glen and Larry's*.

How do we improve our capabilities and efficiency as ice cream
travels between the factory conveyor belt to the shelves of the bodega?

What new technology can we introduce to enhance this process?
How can we do so in a way that will be embraced by both factories
and bodegas with minimal effort?

How do we ensure business continues to operate smoothly if
not everyone adopts our new process on day 1?
