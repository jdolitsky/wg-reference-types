# Upgrading

This document is a place to outline the upgrade path for
both clients and vendors, considering that not all will adopt
the processes designed by this WG at once (or perhaps ever).

## Component defintions

The following icons and definitions will be used to illustate various scenarios
in the context of this document.

### Producer

A producer of images and/or artifacts (a client that "pushes")

| Icon              | State        | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 🌱  (leaf)        | Current      | Cannot push references         |
| 🌿  (tree branch) | Intermediate | Pushes references via tags/"refers" field           |
| 🌲  (whole tree)  | Complete     | Pushes references using new manifest |

### Registry

A service that hosts images and/or artifacts

| Icon            | State        | Description |
| --------------  | ------------ | -- |
| 🚲 (bicycle)    | Current      | References supported via tags/"refers" field |
| ~~🛵 (moped)~~*      | ~~Intermediate~~ | ~~N/A~~ |
| 🏍 (motocycle)  | Complete     | Supports new API and manifest |

*\* It has been determined that there is not a valid "Intermediate" registry state.*

### Consumer

A consumer of images and/or artifacts (a client that "pulls")

| Icon          | State        | Description |
| ------------- | ------------ | -- |
| 🐀 (rat)      | Current      |  Cannot discover references |
| 🐿 (squirrel) | Intermediate | Discovers references via tags |
| 🦫 (beaver)   | Complete     | Discovers references via new API  |

## Scenarios

There are a total of 18 component combinations listed below.
Note: supported scenarios have descriptions in **bold**.

|   | Producer  | Registry | Consumer | Description |
| - | ----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | 🌱  | 🚲  | 🐀  | Present state, no refers |
| 2 | 🌱  | 🚲  | 🐿  | Consumer looking for refers that don't exist |
| 3 | 🌱  | 🚲  | 🦫  | Consumer looking for refers that don't exist |
| 4 | 🌱  | 🏍   | 🐀  | Present state, no refers |
| 5 | 🌱  | 🏍   | 🐿  | Consumer looking for refers that don't exist |
| 6 | 🌱  | 🏍   | 🦫  | Consumer looking for refers that don't exist |
| 7 | 🌿  | 🚲   | 🐀  | Producer creating refers consumer won't see |
| 8 | 🌿  | 🚲   | 🐿  | **Producer / consumer working in compatibility mode with tags** |
| 9 | 🌿  | 🚲   | 🦫  | **Consumer downgrades to find refers via tags** |
| 10 | 🌿  | 🏍   | 🐀  | Producer creating refers consumer won't see |
| 11 | 🌿  | 🏍   | 🐿  | **Producer / consumer working in compatibility mode with tags** |
| 12 | 🌿  | 🏍   | 🦫  | **Registry upgrade tags over new API (???)** |
| 13 | 🌲  | 🚲  | 🐀  | Producer creating refers consumer won't see |
| 14 | 🌲  | 🚲  | 🐿  | **Producer downgrades to push refers via tags** |
| 15 | 🌲  | 🚲  | 🦫  | **Producer downgrades to push refers via tags** |
| 16 | 🌲  | 🏍  | 🐀  | Producer creating refers consumer won't see |
| 17 | 🌲  | 🏍  | 🐿  | **Registry downgrades new manifests to tags (???)** |
| 18 | 🌲  | 🏍  | 🦫  | **Producer / consumer working using complete new API** |

## Registry Transition

1. Registry in current state, referrers pushed as tags. Registries should not block refer field in manifests, but do not need to parse it.
2. Registry indexes refer field in new manifests, reindexes old manifests with a digest tag.
3. Registry enables referrers API and artifact manifest, clients stop pushing or querying digest tags.

## Extensions API for Distribution

Beginning in OCI Distribution Spec v1.1.0 (not yet released), the
[Extensions API for Distribution](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/main/extensions)
will provide a method for asking a registry (or individual repository) for which extensions are supported:

```HTTP
GET /v2/_oci/ext/discover
```

```HTTP
GET /v2/{name}/_oci/ext/discover
```

```HTTP
200 OK
Content-Length: <length>
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "extensions": [
        {
            "name": "_<extension>",
            "description": "",
            "url": "..."
        }
    ]
}
```

This may provide a useful upgrade path as new APIs designed by this WG are
proposed but not yet accepted by other parts of the OCI and wider community.
